1) Create a directory named "cdm" in your Kodi's home directory*
2) Extract the zip file containing your device's architecture in the "cdm" directory.
3) Make sure the "Decrypter path" is set to "special://home/cdm" in the InputStream Adaptive add-on settings.

* This is the directory that also contains "addons", "media", "system", "userdata" and more.
